    <h3>Political Involvement</h3>
    <br>
    <div>
        The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has been actively involved in the political sphere, primarily in
        relation to the Tibetan struggle for autonomy and human rights. Here are some key aspects of his political
        involvement:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Leadership of Tibet: In 1950, at the age of 15, the Dalai Lama assumed political power in Tibet
                following the Chinese invasion of the region. He took on the responsibility of governing Tibet,
                leading the Tibetan people through a challenging period of Chinese rule.
            </li>
            <li>Advocacy for Tibet: The Dalai Lama has been a prominent advocate for the rights and welfare of the
                Tibetan people. He has consistently sought to raise international awareness about the situation in
                Tibet, highlighting human rights abuses, cultural suppression, and environmental degradation taking
                place under Chinese rule.
            </li>
            <li>Non-Violent Resistance: The Dalai Lama has been a steadfast proponent of non-violence in addressing
                the Tibetan issue. Despite the hardships faced by the Tibetan people, he has consistently called for
                peaceful negotiations and dialogue with the Chinese government, advocating for a peaceful resolution
                and the protection of Tibetan culture and religious practices.
            </li>
            <li>Middle Way Approach: The Dalai Lama has put forward the Middle Way Approach as a political strategy
                for resolving the Tibetan issue. This approach seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework
                of the Chinese constitution, rather than outright independence. It aims to find a mutually
                beneficial solution that respects the rights and aspirations of both the Tibetan people and the
                Chinese government.
            </li>
            <li>Exile and Central Tibetan Administration: In 1959, the Dalai Lama was forced into exile following a
                failed uprising against Chinese rule. He established the Central Tibetan Administration (also known
                as the Tibetan Government-in-Exile) in Dharamshala, India, which serves as the Tibetan exile
                government and coordinates efforts to preserve Tibetan culture, provide support to Tibetan refugees,
                and advocate for the Tibetan cause internationally.
            </li>
            <li>International Engagement: The Dalai Lama has engaged in diplomatic efforts and international
                advocacy to garner support for the Tibetan cause. He has met with world leaders, politicians, and
                diplomats, promoting understanding of the Tibetan situation and seeking support for the Tibetan
                people's rights and aspirations.

                The political involvement of the 14th Dalai Lama has centered around advocating for the rights and
                autonomy of Tibet, raising awareness about the Tibetan struggle, and seeking a peaceful resolution
                to the Tibetan issue through dialogue and non-violence. His efforts have made a significant impact
                in highlighting the Tibetan cause on the international stage and advocating for the preservation of
                Tibetan culture and identity.
